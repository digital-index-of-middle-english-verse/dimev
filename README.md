## Contributing

We welcome corrections to DIMEV content.
The best way to report a correction is to [create an "issue"](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue).
The next-best way is to email one of the current custodians of DIMEV, Ian Cornelius or Mike Johnston.

Contributors should be aware that their corrections will not be implemented soon: content corrections are on hold while we review and modernize DIMEV's frameworks for data management.
